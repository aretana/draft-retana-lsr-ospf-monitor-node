   <abstract>
      <t>
      This document specifies mechanisms that allow a node to monitor an OSPF
      network actively without influencing the topology or affecting its
      stability.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
      Monitoring the control plane activity in a network is essential to
      designing and maintaining a robust and stable network.  Passive (listen-
      only) devices deployed in broadcast or non-broadcast multi-access (NBMA)
      networks have typically satisfied the need.  However, passive devices
      depend on more than two routers being present in the network and are not
      visible to the network operator -- anyone can listen.
      </t>
      <t>
      An alternative implementation, primarily used in point-to-point
      interfaces, or in cases where the listening device is the only other node
      on the interface, is to participate fully in the protocol: create a full
      adjacency with the closest router, participate in designated router (DR)
      election, etc.  The node is now visible in the network, can advertise
      control plane information, and any changes in its status are flooded
      throughout the network.  Many link state advertisements (LSA) or state
      changes can cause instability in the network, and additional
      configuration is usually needed to avoid the device becoming a transit
      node.
      </t>
      <t>
      This document specifies mechanisms that allow a node to monitor OSPF
      activity without influencing the topology or affecting its stability
      while being fully adjacent and known to the network operator.  These
      nodes are referred to as a Monitor Node.  Two such mechanisms are
      introduced:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal" empty="true">
      <li>
        <xref target="monitor_interface"/> describes a local implementation to
        be used in the case where the Monitor Node is the only other router on
        an interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <xref target="monitor_node"/> specifies signaling in the Hello message
        for a node to communicate its intention to become a Monitor Node.
      </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
      The mechanisms presented apply to both OSPFv2 <xref target="RFC2328"/>
      and OSPFv3 <xref target="RFC5340"/>.  The term OSPF is used to refer to
      both versions.

      <name>Router Interface Parameters</name>
      <t>
      This document defines the following router interface configurable
      parameters:
      </t>

      <dl newline="true" spacing="normal" indent="8">
        <dt>DoNotAdvertiseLink</dt>
        <dd>
        Indicates whether or not the link is advertised on the local
        router-LSA.  If set to "enabled," the router MUST NOT include a
        corresponding interface description in its router-LSA.  The router MUST
        NOT originate other LSAs related to the link or its addresses.
        Enabling this interface parameter overrides the setting of
        LinkLSASuppression <xref target="RFC5340"/>.
        </dd>
        <dt>DoNotRequestAndIgnoreLSAs</dt>
        <dd>
        Indicates whether or not the router should request and use LSAs from
        other routers on this interface.  If set to "enabled," the router MUST
        consider its Link state request list empty.  Also, the router MUST
        consider the LS age of any received LSA to be equal to MaxAge and
        process it according to Section 13 of <xref target="RFC2328"/>.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </section>


    <section anchor="monitor_interface" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Monitoring Interface</name>
      <t>
      By using the interface parameters specified in
      <xref target="interface_params"/>, a router can treat all neighbors on
      the interface as Monitor Nodes.  To do so, DoNotAdvertiseLink and
      DoNotRequestAndIgnoreLSAs SHOULD be configured simultaneously.  If either
      parameter is configured on a broadcast or NBMA interface, the router MUST
      NOT participate in the Designated Router (DR) selection process.
      </t>
      <t>
      Enabling DoNotAdvertiseLink by itself results in any LSAs originated by
      the Monitor Node not being resolved in the routing table.
      </t>
      <t>
      If only DoNotRequestAndIgnoreLSAs is enabled, the router MUST treat the
      link as a stub network.  Note that the neighbor information
      (corresponding to the Monitor Node) is not advertised.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="monitor_node" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>The Monitor Node Option</name>
      <t>
      This document defines a new Option in the Extended Options and Flags
      (EOF) Link-Local Signaling (LLS) TLV <xref target="RFC5613"/>.  The new
      option is called Monitor (M-bit) and has a value of TBD.
      </t>
      <t>
        When set, the M-bit indicates that the originating router is a Monitor
        Node.  Other routers on the same link MUST:
       </t>
       <ul spacing="normal">
         <li>
        Consider the Monitor Node ineligible for the DR selection process.
        </li>
        <li>
        Consider its Link state request list empty with respect to the Monitor
        Node.
        </li>
        <li>
        Consider the LS age of any LSA received from the Monitor Node is equal
        to MaxAge.
        </li>
       </ul>

       <t>
        If the Monitor Node is one of only two routers on an interface, the
        other router MUST NOT include a corresponding interface description in
        its router-LSA.  Furthermore, other LSAs related to the link or its
        addresses MUST NOT be originated.  This situation overrides the setting
        of LinkLSASuppression.
       </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="operations" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Operational Considerations</name>
      <t>
      The use of the monitoring interface (<xref target="monitor_interface"/>)
      applies to all other routers on the same interface.  While the Monitor
      Node option (<xref target="monitor_node"/>) applies to only the router
      signaling the M-bit.  Network administrators should use the Monitor Node
      option in transit interfaces where one router is a Monitor Node.
      </t>
      <t>
      If the Monitor Node is the only other router on an interface, the link
      information can be advertised (as a stub link) if only
      DoNotRequestAndIgnoreLSAs is enabled.
      </t>
      <t>
      The deployment of the Monitoring Interface
      (<xref target="monitor_interface"/>) requires that only the non-Monitor
      Node supports this specification.  On the other hand, the Monitor Node
      Option (<xref target="monitor_node"/>) requires all nodes on the
      interface to support the functionality.  If support is not present in all
      the routers on the link, the Monitor Node will be eligible to be a DR,
      and its information may be flooded through the network.

   <section anchor="IANA" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>IANA Considerations</name>
      <t>
      IANA is requested to allocate a value (TBD) from the "LLS Type 1 Extended
      Options and Flags" registry for the M-bit (<xref target="monitor_node"/>).
      </t>

    </section>
    <section anchor="Security" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
      The security considerations documented in <xref target="RFC2328"/>,
      <xref target="RFC5340"/>, and <xref target="RFC5613"/> apply to this
      extension.
      </t>
      <t>
      This document defines a new type of node, called a Monitor Node, intended
      only to receive information from its neighbors and not send any.  If the
      LSAs from the Monitor Node are not ignored, they will be flooded
      throughout the network.  A rouge Monitor Node may advertise LSAs with an
      Advertising Router field that doesn't correspond to its router ID.  This
      type of vulnerability is not new, but it is already present in the base
      specification.
      </t>
      <t>
      Even though it is expected that the local network operator deploys any
      Monitor Node, authentication mechanisms such as those specified in
      <xref target="RFC5709"/>, <xref target="RFC7474"/>,
      <xref target="RFC4552"/>, or <xref target="RFC7166"/> SHOULD be used.

                     other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                     Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                     figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                     Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                     added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative
                     images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).

v06 2010-04-01 TT     Changed ipr attribute values to latest ones. Changed date to
                     year only, to be consistent with the comments. Updated the
                     IANA guidelines reference from the I-D to the finished RFC.
